    <!-- Whether WiFi display is supported by this device.
        There are many prerequisites for this feature to work correctly.
        Here are a few of them:
        * The WiFi radio must support WiFi P2P.
        * The WiFi radio must support concurrent connections to the WiFi display and
          to an access point.
        * The Audio Flinger audio_policy.conf file must specify a rule for the "r_submix"
          remote submix module.  This module is used to record and stream system
          audio output to the WiFi display encoder in the media server.
        * The remote submix module "audio.r_submix.default" must be installed on the device.
        * The device must be provisioned with HDCP keys (for protected content).
